    <p> There are many privacy-related reasons to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank" class="body">VPN</a>,
      and probably just as many companies willing to sell you a subscription.
      <a href="https://privacytools.io/providers/vpn/" class="body" target="_blank">Some</a>
      are good, others less so. After about 4 years of being mostly satisfied with
      a paid VPN service, I identified several reasons to build a self-hosted VPN server.</p>

    <p> Despite paid services' privacy assurances, the only guarantee of solid privacy
      practices and implementation is self-hosting. Ideally, a paid VPN service
      should work without DNS leakage, but my paid service would leak DNS look-ups
      if I didn't manually configure a DNS server for each client. After about 4
      years of use, many websites and applications (e.g., banking) also began to
      blacklist my provider's servers. This alone was a breaking point in favor of
      self-hosting. As an added benefit, a self-hosted VPS setup ran $5/month,
      which was less than half the VPN subscription (~$12/month). There is
      also no cap on the number of devices I can run.</p>

    <p>For this implementation, we'll use <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" class="body">Wireguard</a>, a newer and relatively lightweight
      VPN tunneling application developed by Jason A. Donenfeld. <a href="https://jamesbush.dev/posts/210629.html#Notes" class="body">[1]</a>
      In my experience, it is extremely fast, reliable and, from what I've seen,
      cryptographically sound.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Step One: Deploy and Secure Cloud Sever </h4>

    <p>Among many cloud sever providers, I like Linode. A $5/month Nanode
      includes the Linux distro of your choice, 1 CPU, 25GB storage, and 1GB RAM,
      which is enough to run a decent single-home VPN setup. Linode has a detailed
      start-up <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/getting-started/#create-a-linode" class="body" target="_blank">guide</a> on deploying a server. This walk-through
      is based on Ubuntu 20.04.</p>

    <p>Pick a distribution and size. Then set a root password. Note the public
      IPv4 address given when the server is deployed. Open a terminal window on
      your local machine. SSH into your new server by entering:</p>

    <pre><code>ssh root@xx.xx.xx.xx</code></pre>

    <p>Enter the root password set at deployment and you’re in. The terminal should
      display:</p>

      <pre><code>root@localhost</code></pre>

    <p>Linode has a helpful <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/securing-your-server/" class="body" target="_blank">guide</a> on securing
      the server, so that topic is not covered here in detail. At a minimum, make
      sure to 1) create a limited, non-root user account with sudo privileges,
      2) disable password login via SSH, 3) disable root access via SSH, 4)
      enable SSH pre-shared key login, 5) install/activate an
      additional firewall (this guide uses UFW), 6) install and activate
      fail2ban, and 7) close any unused ports.</p>

    <p>Before installing and configuring Wireguard, make sure to set rules in
      UFW that will keep the appropriate ports for SSH and the Wireguard service
      open:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo ufw allow 22/tcp<br>sudo ufw allow 51820/udp<br>sudo ufwenable</code></pre>

    <br>
    <h4>Install Wireguard on Server and Client</h4>
    <p>The first step is to install Wireguard which, on a fresh installation of
      Ubuntu 20.04 or later, should be straightforward: </p>

    <pre><code>sudo apt install wireguard</code></pre>

    <p>Next, the two major steps of setting up Wireguard are 1) configure the server
      and 2) configure the client.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Configure Wireguard Server</h4>

    <p> Root privileges will be required to access the Wireguard directory,
      <code>/etc/wireguard</code>. It’s wise to minimize the amount of work done as root to
      keep from accidentally breaking something, so we’ll only do a couple things.
      Elevate privilege to root and navigate to the Wireguard directory:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo -i <br>cd /etc/wireguard</code></pre>

    <p>In the <code>/etc/wiregaurd</code> directory, create a configuration file with
      Nano (or Vim, etc.):</p>

    <pre><code>nano wg0.conf</code></pre>

    <p>The server configuration file will have two sections, one for the Wireguard
      interface, <code>[Interface]</code>, and one for each client,
      under <code>[Peer]</code>. (Note: server and client refer to eachother as "peer".)
      For the server configuration, each additional client will be listed under a new
      <code>[Peer]</code> heading.

    </p><pre><code>
    [Interface]
    Address = 10.0.0.1/24
    Address = fd86:ea04:1115::1/64
    SaveConfig = true
    PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; ip6tables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; ip6tables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    ListenPort = 51820
    PrivateKey = &lt;server private key&gt;

    [Peer]
    PublicKey = &lt;client public key &gt;
    AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
    </code></pre>

    <p>Below is a breakdown of each of the fields. Under <code>[Interface]</code>:
      </p><ul>
        <li><strong>Address</strong> – these is the private LAN addresses of the server,
          set to 10.0.0.1/24 and fd86:ea04:1115::1/64. You could use
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network" class="body" target="_blank">other</a> ranges as well. </li>
        <li><strong> SaveConfig</strong> – setting to <code>true</code> will save the configuration
          automatically when taken up/down.</li>
        <li><strong>PostUp/PostDown</strong> – the settings outlined for each of these will configure
          the server iptables to forward all client traffic through to the server’s
          internet connection at eth0. Without these, clients cannot connect to
          the internet, only the server’s LAN.</li>
        <li><strong>ListenPort</strong> – this is the port set on the server to accept connections.
        51820 is the port specified in Wireguard’s documentation and commonly used.
        Thus, setting a different port can be a wise extra step for security reasons.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Under <code>[Peer]</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PublicKey</strong> – this is the public key generated on the peer machine.
          Copy/paste it here onto the server’s configuration file.</li>
        <li><strong>AllowedIPs</strong> – this is the IP assigned within the server’s LAN to the
          client peer. Make sure it matches the client's configuration.</li>
      </ul>
    <p> Additional peers must be specified separately. For example, after setting
      10.0.0.2/32 as the first client, so additional client peers could be
      10.0.0.3/32, 10.0.0.4/32, etc. There are a number of other configuration fields.
      See Wireguard’s <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#conceptual-overview" class="body" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more detail.</p>

    <p>Next, save the configuration file by exiting the text editor and saving.
      It can be helpful to keep a backup of whatever configuration you are
      working within <code>/etc/wireguard</code>, because when the configuration
      is loaded, sometimes Wireguard will change/add a few fields. You may also
      want to test different configurations and revert back to an earlier version.
      To create the backup:</p>

    <pre><code>cp wg0.conf wg0.conf.bak</code></pre>

    <p>Since the modifications we need to make the Wireguard directory are done,
      we can exit as root back to our normal account by entering <code>exit</code>
      in the terminal.</p>

    <p>Next, bring up the configuration on the server:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo wg-quick up wg0</code></pre>

    <p>Note: <code>wg-quick</code> is a wrapper for Wireguard that contains
      much of the functionality needed for implementing configurations. Save the
      current configuration:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo wg-quick save wg0</code></pre>

    <p>To ensure the configuration starts when the server
    boots, add the configuration to systemd:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service</code></pre>

    <p>Start the service now:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service</code></pre>

    <p>The server should be ready. Next, we'll configure the client.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Configure Wireguard on Client Side</h4>

    <p>I configured Wireguard on a Linux desktop. It is similar to, but much
    easier than setting up the server. Windows and Mac have their own GUI clients.
    If you create a configuration file like below, load it into the Mac/Windows
    client and you should be good to go. But for a Debain-based Linux distribution,
    first install Wireguard:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo apt install wireguard</code></pre>

    <p>Elevate permissions to root:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo -i</code></pre>

    <p>Navigate to the Wireguard directory:</p>

    <pre><code>cd /etc/wireguard</code></pre>

    <p>Generate a public/private keypair in the  local directory:</p>
    <pre><code>umask 077<br>wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey &gt; publickey</code></pre>

    <p>Create a configuration file:</p>

    <pre><code>nano wg0.conf</code></pre>

    <p>Add the following the the configuration file:</p>

    <pre><code>
    [Interface]
    Address = 10.0.0.3/32
    DNS = 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
    ListenPort = 51820
    PrivateKey = &lt;client private key&gt;

    [Peer]
    PublicKey = &lt;server public key&gt;
    AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
    </code></pre>

    <p>Under <code>[Interface]</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Address</strong> – make sure this address matches the address specified in the
        server side <code>[Peer]</code> configuration—this will be the client’s address on the
        server LAN.</li>
      <li><strong>DNS</strong> – Some guides suggest setting DNS to the server’s default
        addresss, but I could not get the configuration to work without explicitly
        setting an outside DNS. There are several DNS <a href="https://privacytools.io/providers/dns/" target="_blank" class="body">providers</a>
        and 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 are Cloudflare, which is a decent option.</li>
      <li><strong>ListenPort</strong> - 51820 is the same as the server.</li>
      <li><strong>PrivateKey</strong> - enter the client’s private key. The client public/private
        keys will be saved in the <code>/etc/wireguard</code> directory. You can
        copy them from the command line with <code>cat publickey</code> and
        <code>cat privatekey</code> while in the Wireguard directory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under <code>[Peer]</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PublicKey</strong> - enter the server’s public key.</li>
      <li><strong>AllowedIPs</strong> - set this to 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As with the server, save and exit the wg0.conf file and <code>exit</code> root.

    </p><p>Load the configuration:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo wg-quick up wg0</code></pre>

    <p>Save the configuration:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo wg-quick save wg0</code></pre>

    <p>To ensure that the configuration starts when your machine boots,
      add the configuration to systemd:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service</code></pre>

    <p>Start the service now:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service</code></pre>

    <p>The client and server should now be connected. Let's test it.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Testing &amp; Troubleshooting</h4>

    <p>With the server and the client configurations complete and up, there are
      several ways to test the connection. On each machine, check the service
      is running:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0</code></pre>

    <p>The service should display something like:</p>
    <pre><code>● wg-quick@wg0.service - WireGuard via wg-quick(8) for wg0
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/wg-quick@.service; enabled; vendor present: enaled&gt;
     Active: <strong>active (exited)</strong> since Mon 2021-06-28 13:31:56 PDT; 21h ago
       Docs: man:wg-quick(8)
             man:wg(8)
             https://www.wireguard.com/
             https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/
             https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg-quick.8
             https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8
        Process: 1234 ExecStart=/usr/bin/wg-quick up wg0 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
      Main PID: 1234 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)</code></pre>

    <p>Next, ping the server:</p>

    <pre><code>ping 10.0.0.1</code></pre>

    <p>This should return something like:</p>

    <pre><code>PING 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.<br>64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=31.6 ms<br>64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=31.7 ms</code></pre>

    <p>If you receive no response, there is likely a problem in the server or
      client configuration file. Scan each config file carefully to ensure client
      address matches and that your public and private keys are correct. You can
      take down the connection with:</p>

    <pre><code>wudo wg-quick down wg0</code></pre>

    <p>After checking each config file, restart the connection on the client and
      server again with:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo wg-quick up wg0</code></pre>

    <p>If you get a successful ping response, next, ping an outside server:</p>

    <pre><code>ping 1.1.1.1</code></pre>

    <p>If the ping returns a response, traffic is being properly forwarded to the
      internet through the server LAN. If it doesn't, check the configuration of the
      <code>PostUp/PostDown</code> fields in the server config file.
      Make sure the server's network interface (here we use <code>eth0</code>)
      matches server interface when you enter <code>ip link show</code> in a terminal
      window for the server.</p>

    <p>Once receiving a successful ping response to an IPv4 address, try a domain name:</p>

    <pre><code>ping eff.org</code></pre>

    <p>If a ping to a domain name is successful, we know port forwarding is working,
      and DNS look-ups are working as well. At this juncture, by following the Linode guide
      and re-doing the process once, I still had issues. I was getting a ping
      response to outside servers using an IPv4 address, but not a
      domain name. I had a theory this was because the client did not have a DNS
      to lookup domains, so I used Wireguard’s DNS field and set the DNS to
      Cloudflare per above. So, if you can ping outside IPv4 addresses, but not
      domain names, try specifying an external DNS server.</p>

    <p>Now, check the client's public IPv4 address:</p>

    <pre><code>curl icanhazip.com</code></pre>

    <p>The return address should match your server’s IPv4 address.</p>

    <p>Next, make sure you're not getting a DNS leak on look-ups. Open a tab
      in Firefox and check <a href="https://www.dnsleaktest.com/" target="_blank" class="body">DNS Leak Test</a>. The IPv4 address and location should again
      match the server's. Run an "extended test" to check for a DNS leak.
      The DNS server provider display as the one set in the
      configuration file (we used <code>DNS = 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1</code>) for Cloudflare.
      In theory, the location of the DNS server should be near the geographic
      location of your VPS. If you receive more than one server listed or the server
      matches your ISP, you likely have a DNS leak. Double check the configuration files. </p>

    <p>Speed can be tested with a number of services from desktop. Okoola’s works fine.
      One great thing I noticed with my setup was the difference in speed between my
      own VPN service versus my old VPN provider (nearly 10x faster).
      In fact, the new self-hosted VPN setup is comparable in terms of download/upload
      speed to no VPN at all. The latency is a bit higher
      than using no VPN, but it is still better than the old VPN service. Also,
     sites like Craigslist are no longer blacklisted.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

    <p>For a couple days' work and bit of troubleshooting, I was able to build a
      self-hosted VPN server that was about 10 times faster than my old provider
      for half the price and no blacklisting.</p>

    <p>For future improvments, I may change the configuration so that my home
      router connects to the VPN server directly and all attached devices do
      not need separate connections. If you've spotted any bugs in this 
implementation, please drop me a <a href="https://jamesbush.dev/posts/jamesbush.dev/contact.html" class="body">message.</a></p>
